# Robotics Graduate Student at University of Maryland, College Park

## Introduction
I am a graduate student in the Robotics program at the University of Maryland, College Park, focusing on developing methods for robots to operate in unstructured environments. My interests include robot perception, control, and planning. I have a Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering and have been involved in several robotics competitions and teaching assistant for intro to robotics course. Outside of academics, I enjoy hiking and tinkering with electronics. Feel free to reach out to me for collaboration or further information, find my CV and publications on the links provided.

## Skills
- Strong understanding of robotics concepts and principles
- Experience with robot perception, control, and planning
- Proficient in programming languages such as C++ and Python
- Familiarity with ROS (Robot Operating System)
- Strong analytical and problem-solving skills
- Experience with computer vision and machine learning techniques

## Technology stack
- Programming languages: C++, Python
- Robotics frameworks: ROS
- Computer Vision Libraries: OpenCV, PCL
- Machine Learning Libraries: TensorFlow, PyTorch
- Control and Planning Libraries: MoveIt, OMPL
- Other Tools: Git, Linux

Please note that the technology stack may vary depending on the project and that this list is not exhaustive.
Please note that the above is the code of the readme.md file. To see it in the proper format you will need to create a readme.md file in your repository and paste the code there.

give more graphical options 
Here are a few options to make the README more graphical:

Add a header image that represents robotics or the specific field you are working in.
Include screenshots or videos of any projects you have worked on to provide a visual representation of your work.
Use bullet points or numbered lists to make the information more organized and easy to read.
Use code blocks for any code snippets you want to include in the README.
Use badges to showcase any accomplishments or achievements, such as the number of GitHub stars on a project.
Use tables to display technical information, such as the technology stack used in a project.
Use headings and subheadings to structure the README and make it easier to navigate.
Use links to include external resources, such as your CV or publications.
Include an 'About Me' section with a photo and a brief description of yourself to make the README more personal.
Add contact information (e.g. email, LinkedIn, GitHub) to make it easy for others to get in touch with you.
Please note that the visual aspect of the readme depends on the markdown language, so it's better to check how it looks on your repository, and adjust it accordingly.




Aditya Chaugule
give a code example to deploy directly
Here is an example of a code snippet that can be used to deploy a project directly from GitHub:

Copy code
git clone https://github.com/username/projectname.git
cd projectname
npm install
npm start
This code assumes that the project is using npm (Node Package Manager) as the package manager, and that there is a script named `start

## Projects
### Project 1: Unstructured Environment Navigation
![Project Screenshot](project1-screenshot.jpg)

This project involved developing a perception and control system for a robot to navigate in unstructured environments, such as natural disaster sites or construction sites. The goal of this project is to enable robots to operate safely and effectively in these environments, while also reducing the need for human intervention.

### Project 2: Object Detection and Tracking
![Project Screenshot](project2-screenshot.jpg)

In this project, we developed a system for detecting and tracking objects in real-time using a combination of computer vision and machine learning techniques. The system was tested on a mobile robot platform and was able to accurately detect and track objects in its environment.
